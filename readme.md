# Niklas' TADA68 layout
## Trying to get the most out of this board in terms of controlling i3wm, vim and such.

### Major changes:
Changed CapsLock	-> Win <br />
Changed ` and ~		-> ~ only <br />
Left Shift pressed alone opens paranthesis, Right Shift pressed alone closes paranthesis. <br />
Moved some keys on the FN-layer <br />
